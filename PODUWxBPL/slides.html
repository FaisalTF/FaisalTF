						<section>
							<p style='font-size: 75%; text-align: left'>This analysis explores trends throughout the programs provided within the ImBlaze platform, the benefeciary students and their experience, partner schools and mentors, and the industries these opportunities are happening within, with the hopes of accomplishing the following:
							<ul style='font-size: 60%;	'> <br>
								<li>To help the ImBlaze team maintain and adapt the platform to student needs.</li> <br>
								<li>More broadly, to understand student experiences and interests towards next steps at the high school level.</li>
							</ul>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3>Disclaimer Caveats:</h3>
							<ul style='font-size:45%'> <p >Along with the insights brought up throughout this analysis, the following points need to be taken into account:</p>
								<li>This analysis explores data from within a specific time-window,<sup>*</sup> a window that may have been influenced by driving factors (seasonal, educational, that may prevent extrapolating these temporal trends linearly or otherwise constantly.</li> <br>
								<li>Trends relating to opportunity fields and industries all directly rely on ImBlaze's expansion history and patterns, which occour irregularly across different fields - program addition frequently occours through staff and student connections, which may be skewed throughout the different schools. </li> <br>

						<h4>Student Activity</h4>
						<div>
							<img src="figures/studentActivity.png" alt="" >
							<p class='subtext'>The previous chart visualizes student log counts per month. Annual trends in student activity seem to peak during the second half of the year, potentially relevant to summertime and school vacations.
						The COVID-19 pandemic is also notably represented by the drop off during the early months of 2020. The number of logs drops from approximately 17,500 in February 2020 to around 250 logs in March 2020 which precisely aligns with the start of the pandemic in the United States. However, while health protocols and measures from the pandemic were still enforced during the following year (2021), activity seemed to have risen back surpassing 2019 numbers. </p>

							Internship requests from students grew more than three-fold from 2017 to 2019 but fell in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. Requests in the first half of 2021 are returning to pre-pandemic levels, suggesting that the effect is transitory. </p> </div>
						<div class='double'> <p><b>Fewer students are requesting internships for each opening.</b><br>

						<p style='font-size: 55%; text-align: left; color: #ccc'> <b>Sentiment Analysis: </b>To dive deeper into understanding the student experience, another Natural Langauge Processing (NLP) technique was preformed. Sentiment Analysis utilizes machine learning to try to extract emotions and attitudes from a given piece of text, and ranks its sentiment from most positive, to most negative.
						<br> <br> In this analysis, sentiment analysis was performed,<sup>*</sup> ranking each student log entry with a sentiment score ranging from <em style='color:green'>1</em> (most positive), to <em style='color:red'>-1</em> (most negative); with 0 representing neutral sentiment according to the model.
						<br> <br> An additional measurment was calculated, <b>Sentiment Difference</b>, which is simply the difference between a student's sentiment scores during their check-in and check-out comments. Iedally, this would capture a student's setniment towards how they felt about their day.</p>

					<h6>Sentiment Analysis Methodology</h6>
					<p style='font-size: 50%; text-align: left; color:#ccc'>

Two main techniques were utilized to ensure that we are getting the accurate values for the sentiment score associated with a piece of literature. The first technique involves the cleaning the data to only include valid check-in and checkout comments. Various NLP techniques such as lemmatizing are used to filter out strings that usually give inaccurate sentiment values such a string with only 2 or 3 words in them. After performing the different filtering techniques, the initial dataset was reduced from roughly 200K logs to around 60,000 records, approximately 30% of the starting dataset. <br> <br>

The second technique that was used was calculating the sentiment value for a piece of string using three different methods and averaging their results. The first method is to get sentiment value from the TextBlob NLP library, whose sentiment analysis tools are based off the Pattern library, which focuses on adjectives and was trained on customer review from popular online shopping platforms. The second method uses NTLK library’s Naïve Bayes Classifier which is a machine learning model trained on a large corpus of movie reviews. Finally, the last method utilizes VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) library which was trained on comments scrapped from various social media platforms. The average sentiment from these methods is normalized to map the value from 0.0 (most negative) to 1.0 (most positive).  </p>
